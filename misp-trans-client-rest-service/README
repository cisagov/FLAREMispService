Build an executable JAR

You can run the application from the command line with Gradle or Maven. 
Or you can build a single executable JAR file that contains all the necessary 
dependencies, classes, and resources, and run that. This makes it easy to ship, 
version, and deploy the service as an application throughout the development 
lifecycle, across different environments, and so forth.


If you are using Maven, you can run the application using 

mvn spring-boot:run. 


Or you can build the JAR file with 

mvn clean package. 

Then you can run the JAR file:

java -jar target/mtc-rest-service-0.1.0.jar
